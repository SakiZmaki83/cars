            <p>
                A car (or automobile) is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation.
                Most definitions of car say they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people,
                have four tires, and mainly transport people rather than goods. The car is one of the most fascinating devices that a person can own. Cars are also one of the most pervasive devices, with a typical American family owning two cars.
                A car contains dozens of different technologies. Everything from the engine to the tires is its own special universe of design and engineering. Have you ever opened the hood of your car and wondered what was going on in there? A car engine can look like a big confusing jumble of metal, tubes and wires to the uninitiated.
                You might want to know what's going on simply out of curiosity.  </p>
